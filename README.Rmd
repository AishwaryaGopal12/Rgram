The goal of Rgram is to make the image processing task easy and intuitive. With RGram, users can rotate the image, convert it to greyscale, flip it in either a horizontal or vertical direction, and add padding to it (frame).

## Installation

You can install the released version of Rgram from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Rgram")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Rgram)
## basic example code
```

## Documentation

The help file can be viewed by:

```{r}
?padding
?flipping
?rotate
?greyscale
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
